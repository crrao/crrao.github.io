Hello! I'm Chirag Rao, a fourth-year PhD student in the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS) at MIT. Currently, my focus is on low-latency satellite network design. In general, I'm interested in applying tools from probability, optimization, and machine learning to problems in networks and communication.

I received my master's degree in Aeronautics and Astronautics from MIT in 2022. Prior to joining MIT, I obtained a master's degree in Computer Science from Johns Hopkins University in 2018. I received a bachelor of science degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Cornell University in 2013.

When I'm not at the lab, I'm usually hiking/biking/skiing around the New England Area, or experimenting in the kitchen: fermenting vegetables, making sourdough bread, brewing kombucha, or baking cakes. I'm also a white belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.
