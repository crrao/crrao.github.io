Hello! I'm Chirag Rao, a fourth-year PhD student in the [Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS)](https://lids.mit.edu) at MIT, where I am advised by [Prof. Eytan Modiano](https://modiano.mit.edu). I am also a computer engineer at the [Army Research Laboratory](https://arl.devcom.army.mil). Currently, my research focus is on designing low-latency satellite networks. In general, I'm interested in applying tools from probability, optimization, and machine learning to problems in networks and communication.

I received my master's degree in Aeronautics and Astronautics from MIT in 2022. Prior to joining MIT, I obtained a master's degree in Computer Science from Johns Hopkins University in 2018. I received a bachelor of science degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Cornell University in 2013.

When I'm not at the lab, I'm usually hiking/biking/skiing around the New England Area, or experimenting in the kitchen: fermenting vegetables, making sourdough bread, brewing kombucha, or baking cakes. I'm also a white belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.
